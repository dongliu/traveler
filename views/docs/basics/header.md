## Basics of the traveler application

**Audience: all users**

The [travelers](#traveler) are electronic documents created from predefined
[templates](#form). A traveler lists the tasks in order to finish the work
defined by the released work template. The user records data and notes when
performing the tasks. Travelers can be grouped into working packages named
[binders](#binder).

Besides web based user interface, the traveler application provides a simple
HTTP [API](#api) for other applications to operate templates, travelers, and
binders.
