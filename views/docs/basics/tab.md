### Tabs and tables

The templates, travelers, and binders pages use tabs to separate entities in
different statuses. In each tab, the entities are listed in a table. There are
two places that a button can be placed on a tabbed page. On each list page, when
a button is located on top of the tabs, the button's action is applicable to all
the tabs and tables inside the tabs. When a button is located **inside** a tab,
then the button's action is only applicable to that tab and table.

Around a table, there are 6 areas each of which either hold optional tools or
display information.

| area | location     | content                                                             |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | top left     | a select input to change the number of records shown per table page |
| 2    | top middle   | show a message when the data inside the table is in processing      |
| 3    | top right    | a text input to filter all the columns in the table                 |
| 4    | bottom row   | text inputs to filter the corresponding table column                |
| 5    | bottom left  | the numbers of entries out of the total number shown in the view    |
| 6    | bottom right | pagination controls                                                 |

Some tables have extra tools that allow a user to copy, export, or print the
table. The traveler application uses
[the datatables js library](https://datatables.net/) for the tables in web UI.
Many pages in the application are still on an old version of the library, and
the tools are not supported by browsers due to the dependency on the flash
technology. We are in the process of updating those pages to use the latest
version of the datatables library.
