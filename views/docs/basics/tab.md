### Tabs and tables

The forms, travelers, and binders pages use tabs for different list of entities.
In each tab, the entities are listed in a table. There are two places that a
button can be placed on a tabbed page. If a button is located on top of the
tabs, the button's action is applicable to all the tabs and tables inside the
tabs. If a button is location **inside** a tab, then the button's action only is
applicable to that tab and table.

A typical table has 6 areas each of which either hold a tool or display
information.

| area | location     | content                                                             |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | top left     | a select input to change the number of records shown per table page |
| 2    | top middle   | show a message when the data inside the table is in processing      |
| 3    | top right    | a text input to filter all the columns in the table                 |
| 4    | bottom row   | text inputs to filter the corresponding table column                |
| 5    | bottom left  | the numbers of entries out of the total number shown in the view    |
| 6    | bottom right | pagination controls                                                 |
