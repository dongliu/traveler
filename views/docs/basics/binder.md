### What is a binder?

A binder is a collection of travelers that a user puts together for easy
management. By the name, one can think it as a virtual folder containing
travelers related a specific top. For example, an engineer can put all the
travelers related to a specific device into one binder. A workshop manager can
put all the traveler involving the workshop into one binder. One traveler can be
put into multiple binders.

When a traveler is added into a binder, it has properties like sequence,
priority, value, and color. The sequence and priority help to sort the
travelers. The value can be used to estimate the binder's progress. The color
defines a flag for attention. A binder can be put into another binder. This is
useful for higher management to oversee the progress of sub teams. For more
details, see the [binders section](#binders).
