### What is a binder?

A binder is a collection of travelers that a user put together for easier and
better management and presentations. For example, an engineer can put all the
travelers related to a specific device into one binder. A workshop manager can
put all the traveler involving the workshop into one binder. A traveler can be
put into different binders.

When a traveler is added into a binder, it has properties like sequence,
priority, value, and color. The sequence and priority help to sort the
travelers. The value can be used to estimate the binder's progress. The color
defines a flag for attention. It is possible to add a binder into another
binder. This is useful for higher management to oversee the progress of sub
teams. For more details, see the [binders section](#binders).
