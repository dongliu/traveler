### What is a binder?

A binder is a collection of works that a user puts together for easy management.
The traveler is a typical type of work. It is like a virtual folder containing
the works related to a specific topic. For example, an engineer can put all the
travelers related to a specific device into one binder. A workshop manager can
put all the travelers involved in the workshop into one binder. One traveler can
be put into multiple binders.

A work has properties like Sequence, Priority, Value, and color. The sequence is
a counting number defining the order to perform the works. The priority is a
counting number defining the importance, and one is the highest priority level.
The value represents the planned cost or the earning that the work will
contribute to a project as that used in
[earned value management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management).
The color defines a status flag with a color code. A binder can be put into
another binder. This is useful for higher management to oversee the progress of
sub teams. For more details, see the [binders section](#binders).
