### What is a template?

A template is the documentation for a predefined process. A user can execute the
process multiple times and collect data during the executions. A template can
contain multiple sequenced sections, and each section can contain instructions
and inputs.

A user can design a template in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor.
Each template has a life cycle, and can be managed by users with special roles.
Users can only create travelers from the released templates. The
[templates section](#forms) describes the details of how to work with templates.

There are two types of templates --- normal templates and discrepancy templates.
A normal template defines a sequence of actions and data points to collect. A
discrepancy template is for the QA process, in which the data collected in a
normal process is examined and requested for correction. A normal template can
be used on its own, while a discrepancy template has to be used together with a
normal template.
