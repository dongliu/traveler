### Print

In most cases, the user can print the page to either PDF or a real printer with
the browser's print function. The traveler pages have a dedicated view to be
print format friendly. On a traveler page, clicking on the
<button class="btn btn-primary">Create PDF</button> button will open a new tab
of the print view. On the print view, the user can use the top toggles to show
or hide the validation, notes, and details information.

The traveler report page loads the table view of the data inside a group of
travelers. The user can generate a PDF file or print the table with the tools on
the page directly.
