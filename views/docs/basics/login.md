### Log in and out

Besides this document and the main page, all other resources are only accessible
to **authenticated** users. Users can use their lab computer user name and
password to log in. Users are encouraged to log out when they do not work with
the application. If not log out, a user's session will expire after a period.
When a user tries to access a resource URL on a browser with no live session,
the user will be directed to the log in page, and be redirected back to the
requested URL if login succeeds.
