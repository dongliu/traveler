### Log in and out

Besides this document page and the main page, all other resources are only
accessible to **authenticated** users. Users can use their organization username
and password to log in. Users are encouraged to log out when they do not work
with the application. If not log out, a user's session will expire after a
period. When a user tries to access a resource URL on a browser with an expired
session, the user will be directed to the login page, and be redirected back to
the requested URL if login succeeds.

When a page contains unsaved content and the session has expired, an error
message will appear on the top of the page when the user tries to save. Log in
the application in a **new** tab or page, and then save the change again. Do not
close or navigate away from the page that contains the unsaved changes,
otherwise the unsaved changes will be lost
