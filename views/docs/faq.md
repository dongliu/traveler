## FAQ

**Audience: all users**

_Q: I cannot save the updates and I have the write permission._

A: If you see warning messages on the top of the traveler page when you made
updates, then the warning message should include the reason. If your session is
timed out, you can log in in a new browser tab or windows, and come back the
current tab and continue.

_Q: My browser cannot find the traveler server._

A: Please connect to VPN and load the traveler application URL.

_Q: How to delete a template, a traveler or a binder?_

A: You **cannot** delete an entity (a form, a traveler, or a binder) in the
traveler application once it is created. You can **archive** them. You can
always **de-archive** an entity from your "archived" tab, to work on them again.

_Q: How to correct the data or note in a traveler?_

A: You **cannot** "revise" the input data in a traveler. You can always input a
new value into the input where you want to correct. You might also want to add a
note to the input in order to explain the reason for the update.

_Q: I cannot update the data in a traveler._

A: If you cannot load the traveler page, then you do not have permission to view
the traveler, or the traveler does not exist, or the owner of the traveler has
archived it. If you can load the traveler page, but the inputs are disabled,
then you do not have the write permission, or the traveler is not active.

_Q: How to let other users contribute to a traveler?_

A: You need to **share** your traveler with them. Please see the
[ownership and access control section](#ownership) for more details.
