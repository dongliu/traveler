## FAQ

_Q: Why I cannot save the updates I made in a traveler that I have the write permission?_

A: If you see warning messages on the top of the traveler page when you made updates, then the warning message will give you a hint. If your session is timed out, then you can log in in a new browser tab or windows to continue your work. If you do not see the warning messages and you are working in IE, please try Firefox or Chrome.  

_Q: How the access the traveler application from home or on wifi?_

A: You can access the application at [https://intra-gw.nscl.msu.edu/traveler/](https://intra-gw.nscl.msu.edu/traveler/). You will need to input your user name and password twice. The first time for the intra-gw gateway, and the second time for the traveler application. 

_Q: How to remove or delete a form, a traveler or a binder?_

A: You **cannot** delete an item (a form, a traveler, or a binder) in the traveler application once it is created. If you think the item is not relevant, and you want it to disappear from other users' personal views, and also your tabs, you can **archive** them. You can always **de-archive** an item from your "archived" tab, to work on them again. 

_Q: How to correct what I input in a traveler? Can I revise it?_

A: You **cannot** "revise" the input data in a traveler. You can always input a new value into the input where you want to correct. You might also want to add a note to the input in order to explain the reason for the update. 

_Q: Why can't I update the data in a traveler?_

A: If you cannot load the traveler page, then you do not have permission to view the traveler, or the traveler does not exist, or the owner of the traveler has archived it. If you can load the traveler page, but the inputs are disabled, then you do not have the write permission, or the traveler is not active. In either case, the traveler owner can help you.   

_Q: How to let other users contribute to a traveler or see what is going on in it?_

A: You need to **share** your traveler with them. Please see the [ownership and access control section](#ownership) for more details. 

_Q: A colleague is leaving or be unavailable for a while. How to continue her/his work in the traveler application?_

A: We suggest the person to leave the lab to [transfer the ownership](#ownership) of her/his forms, travelers or binders to the colleague to continue the work or her/his line manager. If such an arrangement was not carried out before the leaving, please contact the administrator to make the ownership transfer.
