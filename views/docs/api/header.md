## Application programming interface

**Audience: developers**

The traveler application provides a limited API (application programming
interface) besides the Web interface. The API is designed in a
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) style.
Currently, other applications can read the information of travelers through the
API.
