## Travelers

**Audience: traveler users**

The start page for working with travelers is [/travelers/](/travelers/). There
are five tabs on the page: [My travelers](/travelers/#travelers),
[Transferred travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers),
[Shared travelers](/travelers/#sharedtravelers),
[Group shared travelers](/travelers/#groupsharedtravelers), and
[Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers). The
[My travelers](/travelers/#travelers) tab contains a table of the travelers
**created** by you. The
[Transferred travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers) tab contains a table
of the travelers **transferred** to you by other users. The
[Shared travelers](/travelers/#sharedtravelers) tab contains a table of the
travelers **shared** with you by other users. The
[Group shared travelers](/travelers/#groupsharedtravelers) tab contains a table
of the travelers **shared** with **your groups** by other users. The
[Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers) tab contains a table of the
travelers **archived** by you. You are the **owner** of all the travelers in
[My travelers](/travelers/#travelers) tab,
[Transferred travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers) tab, and
[Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers) tab. The owner is
responsible to [configure](#config-traveler), [share](#share-traveler),
[active and approve the completion](#traveler-status) of a traveler.

A traveler can be located by its URL. The URL is like `/travelers/longstringid/`
where the `longstringid` is the traveler's unique identity. The user can
bookmark the traveler's URL or send it to other users. A user needs to have at
least read permission to view a traveler. See the
[sharing traveler](#share-traveler) section for details.
