## Work with travelers

**Audience: traveler users**

The start page for working with travelers is [/travelers/](/travelers/). There are five tabs on the page: [My travelers](/travelers/#travelers), [Transfered travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers), [Shared travelers](/travelers/#sharedtravelers), [Group shared travelers](/travelers/#groupsharedtravelers), and [Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers). The [My travelers](/travelers/#travelers) tab contains a table of the travelers **created** by you. The [Transfered travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers) tab contains a table of the travelers **transferred** to you by other users. The [Shared travelers](/travelers/#sharedtravelers) tab contains a table of the travelers **shared** with you by other users. The [Group shared travelers](/travelers/#groupsharedtravelers) tab contains a table of the travelers **shared** with **your groups** by other users. The [Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers) tab contains a table of the travelers **archived** by you. You are the **owner** of all the travelers in [My travelers](/travelers/#travelers) tab, [Transfered travelers](/travelers/#transferredtravelers) tab, and [Archived travelers](/travelers/#archivedtravelers) tab. The owner is responsible to [configure](#config-traveler), [share](#share-traveler), [active the traveler and approve the completion](#traveler-status) of a traveler.

A traveler can be located by its URL. The URL is like `/travelers/longstringid/` where the `longstringid` is the traveler's unique identity. You can bookmark the traveler's URL or send it in your messages to other users. A user needs to have at least read permission to view a traveler. See the [sharing traveler](#share-traveler) section for details.
