### Update the data and notes in a traveler

**Audience: traveler users with write permission**

In order to update the data and notes of a traveler, the user must have the
write permission of the traveler.

A traveler's data can be updated only when it is in the
[active status](#traveler-status). When the traveler is in other statuses, all
the inputs are disabled on the traveler page. Note on the traveler view page,
the user cannot update data or notes on that page even if s/he has write
permission.

When the user inputs a new value in an input, two buttons will appear on the
right side. Click the <button value="save" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
button to submit the change to the traveler server. Or click the
<button value="reset" class="btn">Reset</button> button to reset to the original
value. All other inputs are disable when an input is touched. If the change is
saved on the server, there will be a

<div class="alert alert-success"><button class="close">x</button>Success</div>
message on the top of the page. If something is wrong, then an 
<div class="alert alert-error"><button class="close">x</button>Error</div>
message will appear.

In order to add a new note, click the
<a class="new-note" data-toggle="tooltip" title="new note"><i class="fa fa-file-o fa-lg"></i></a>
icon. Click the <span class="badge badge-info">n</span> icon to show/hide the
notes.
