### What is a traveler?
A traveler is an electrical document that is designed to support the execution of a predefined process and collects user input data and notes in the process. The process and its user inputs are defined in a [form](#form). The owner of a traveler can update the form in the traveler during the carryout. However, the use of a new form might have impact of the traveler data that have already been collected. A traveler has properties like title, description, deadline, locations, and tags. The user can add/remove a tag into the tag list. The tag can be a device name defined in CCDB or any string. A traveler is **initialized** when it is created. Its state can be changed to **active**, **submitted for completion**, **completed**, and **frozen**. A traveler can be archived. Only the owner can access an archived traveler. A traveler owner can [share](#ownership) her/his traveler with other users/groups. A user can also [transfer](#ownership) the ownership of a traveler to other user.
