### Normal templates

Most traveler use cases can be covered with normal templates. The user can
define most common HTML input types, including numbers, date, short text, long
text, radio button, checkbox, and file upload in a normal template. The user can
also include instructive directions of text, diagrams, and formulas in a normal
template. A normal template supports numbered sections for easy navigation and
reference.
