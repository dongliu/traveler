### normal templates

When the traveler application was first designed, there is only one type of
template, and it is what we call normal template in this document. A normal
template should satisfy most use cases for the traveler application. One can
include instructive directions with text, diagrams, and formulas in a template.
It can include most common HTML input type, like numbers, date, short text, long
text, radio button, checkbox, and file upload. One can also structure the
template into sections for better reference and organization.

A normal template is designed as an HTML form, and represented as an HTML form
in the traveler during the execution and when finished.
