## Templates

**Audience: traveler users, especially process owner**

Before create travelers, a user needs to design a template and release it in the
traveler application. A traveler template mimics the paper traveler so that a
process owner defines the sequence of actions, include action instructions if
need, and specify the data to be collected in each step.
