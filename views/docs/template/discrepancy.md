### discrepancy template

As the name suggests, we introduced the discrepancy template into the traveler
application mainly for the quality assurance (QA) process. When the task
specified in a traveler reaches the stage of completion or milestone, a QA
personal will check if the data collected satisfy the expectation. If not, it is
a discrepancy. Very naturally, a discrepancy will require a correction. When a
correction finishes, the traveler is updated, and a QA process will kick in
again. By recording each instance of discrepancy, the team will have better
understanding of the task in the aspects like which part of the work is more
error prone, which might suggest an improvement of workflow.

A discrepancy template is designed as an HTML form. A user inputs data in a form
view inside a traveler, and represented in a table each row of which is a
discrepancy instance.
