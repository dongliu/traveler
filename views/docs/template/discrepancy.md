### Discrepancy template

A discrepancy template can be used for a quality assurance (QA) like process. It
is owned by the QA process owner, who has the responsibility to verify the
result of a traveler. When a traveler is ready for quality assurance, a QA
personal will check if the result meets the expectation. A discrepancy is logged
if the work does not pass QA, which will be followed by a correction. The
correction will be recorded in the traveler with data updates. Then a new QA
iteration can be triggered.

A released discrepancy template cannot used solely without being attached to a
released normal template when creating a traveler.
