### Discrepancy template

As the name suggests, the discrepancy template is for the quality assurance (QA)
process. When the process specified in a traveler reaches the stage of
completion or milestone, a QA personal will check if the data collected meets
the expectation. If not, it is a discrepancy. In most cases, a discrepancy will
require a correction. When a correction finishes, the traveler is updated, and
the new result will be check again. By recording each instance of discrepancy,
the team will have better understanding of the process, e.g. which part of the
process is more error prone, which might lead to an improvement of the process.

A traveler cannot be created from a released discrepancy template. In order to
use a release discrepancy template, it has to be attached to a released normal
template.
