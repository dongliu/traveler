###  Tabs and tables
The forms, travelers, and binders pages use tabs for different list of entities. In each tab, the entities are listed in a table. There are two places that a button can be placed on a tabbed page. If a button is located on top of the tabs, the button's action is applicable to all the tabs and tables inside the tabs. If a button is location **inside** a tab, then the button's action only is applicable to that tab and table. 

A typical table has 6 areas each of which either hold a tool or display information. 

|area | location | content|
|---------| --------|-------- |
|1 | top left | a select input to change the number of records shown per table page |
|2 | top middle | show a message when the data inside the table is in processing |
|3 | top right | a text input to filter all the columns in the table |
|4 | bottom row | text inputs to filter the corresponding table column |
|5 | bottom left | the numbers of entries out of the total number shown in the view |
|6 | bottom right | pagination controls |
