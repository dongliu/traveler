### Log in and out
Besides this document and the main page, all other resources are only accessible to authenticated users. Users can use their lab computer user name and password to log in. Users are encouraged to log out when they do not work with the application. If not log out, a user's session will expire after a period. When a user tries to access a resource URL on a browser with no live session, the user will be directed to the log in page, and be redirected back to the requested URL if login succeeds.
