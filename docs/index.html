<p><strong>Audience: all users</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#traveler">travelers</a> are electronic documents created from predefined
<a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#form">templates</a>. A traveler lists the tasks in order to finish the work
defined by the released work template. The user records data and notes when
performing the tasks. Travelers can be grouped into working packages named
<a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#binder">binders</a>.</p>
<p>Besides web based user interface, the traveler application provides a simple
HTTP <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#api">API</a> for other applications to operate templates, travelers, and
binders.</p>
<p><img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/traveler-flow.png" alt="traveler flow"></p>
</header><section id="template"><h3 id="what-is-a-template-">What is a template?</h3>
<p>A template is the documentation for a predefined process. A user can execute the
process multiple times and collect data during the executions. A template can
contain multiple sequenced sections, and each section can contain instructions
and inputs.</p>
<p>A user can design a template in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor.
Each template has a life cycle, and can be managed by users with special roles.
Users can only create travelers from the released templates. The
<a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#forms">templates section</a> describes the details of how to work with templates.</p>
<p>There are two types of templates --- normal templates and discrepancy templates.
A normal template defines a sequence of actions and data points to collect. A
discrepancy template is for the QA process, in which the data collected in a
normal process is examined and requested for correction. A normal template can
be used on its own, while a discrepancy template has to be used together with a
normal template.</p>
</section><section id="traveler"><h3 id="what-is-a-traveler-">What is a traveler?</h3>
<p>A traveler is an electrical document that supports the execution of a predefined
process in a normal template and to collect user input data and notes in the
process. It also supports collections of discrepancy QA logs with a discrepancy
template.</p>
<p>A traveler has properties like title, description, deadline, locations, devices,
and tags. The user can add/remove multiple tags into the tag list. Tags can be
used to group and find travelers. A device is a special type of tag that
represents a physical entity related to the traveler. The user creates a new
traveler when <strong>initializing</strong> it from a <strong>released</strong> template. Its state can be
changed to <strong>active</strong>, <strong>submitted for completion</strong>, <strong>completed</strong>, and
<strong>frozen</strong>. A traveler, either finished or not, can be <strong>archived</strong> when it
needs no more attention from users. Only the traveler owner can access the
traveler when it is archived. A traveler owner can <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#ownership">share</a> her/his
traveler with other users/groups. A user can also <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#ownership">transfer</a> the
ownership of a traveler to another user.</p>
<p>The users with written permission to a traveler can input values into an
<strong>active</strong> traveler. The input <strong>history</strong> is kept with the traveler. Each input
can also have user notes attached to it. Optionally, a traveler can contain the
history of discrepancies. A traveler can be considered as the composition of a
released form/template, the input data, the notes, and discrepancy logs:</p>
<p><strong>traveler = template + data + notes [+ discrepancy logs]</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#travelers">travelers section</a> provides more detailed information about how
to create, update, and manage travelers.</p>
</section><section id="binder"><h3 id="what-is-a-binder-">What is a binder?</h3>
<p>A binder is a collection of works that a user puts together for easy management.
The traveler is a typical type of work. It is like a virtual folder containing
the works related to a specific topic. For example, an engineer can put all the
travelers related to a specific device into one binder. A workshop manager can
put all the travelers involved in the workshop into one binder. One traveler can
be put into multiple binders.</p>
<p>A work has properties like Sequence, Priority, Value, and color. The sequence is
a counting number defining the order to perform the works. The priority is a
counting number defining the importance, and one is the highest priority level.
The value represents the planned cost or the earning that the work will
contribute to a project as that used in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management">earned value management</a>.
The color defines a status flag with a color code. A binder can be put into
another binder. This is useful for higher management to oversee the progress of
sub teams. For more details, see the <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#binders">binders section</a>.</p>
</section><section id="login"><h3 id="log-in-and-out">Log in and out</h3>
<p>Besides this document page and the main page, all other resources are only
accessible to <strong>authenticated</strong> users. Users can use their organization username
and password to log in. Users are encouraged to log out when they do not work
with the application. If not log out, a user's session will expire after a
period. When a user tries to access a resource URL on a browser with an expired
session, the user will be directed to the login page, and be redirected back to
the requested URL if login succeeds.</p>
<p>When a page contains unsaved content and the session has expired, an error
message will appear on the top of the page when the user tries to save. Log in
the application in a <strong>new</strong> tab or page, and then save the change again. Do not
close or navigate away from the page that contains the unsaved changes,
otherwise the unsaved changes will be lost</p>
</section><section id="ownership"><h3 id="ownership-roles-and-access-control">Ownership, roles, and access control</h3>
<p>The traveler application supports <strong>role based</strong> and <strong>attribute based</strong> access
control. When a user requests to access a resource, both the user's roles in the
current session and the resource's access related attributes are considered. The
access is granted if either the role or the attribute allows.</p>
<p>There are three special roles, admin, manager, and reviewer. A user can be
associated with multiple roles. Only an admin can modify a user's roles. Only a
reviewer can review a submitted template to release. An admin or a manager is
capable of reading and writing all resources in the application.</p>
<p>The traveler application has three important entity types: template, traveler,
and binder. Each type has three attributes to control the access, the ownership,
sharing, and public accessibility.</p>
<p>There are three levels of access privileges: no access, read, and write. The
details are listed in the following table.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>access privilege</th>
<th>details</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>no access</td>
<td>rejected when requesting to access an entity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>read</td>
<td>view the representation of an entity, but will not be able to modify the entity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>write</td>
<td>be able to view and modify the entity</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Every entity has an owner. The <strong>owner</strong> is the user who creates the entity. An
entity’s ownership can be transferred to a different user by its current owner.
The owner, by default, has the privilege to configure attributes of the entity
including the sharing and public accessibility.</p>
<p>The owner user can share an entity with other individual users or groups with
read or write permission. The shared entity will also appear in the <em>shared
entity</em> tab or the <em>group shared entity</em> tab of a user.</p>
<p>The entity owner can configure an entity to be publicly readable or writable.
All the public available entities are listed on the <em>all public forms</em> or <em>all
public travelers</em> pages.</p>
</section><section id="tab"><h3 id="tabs-and-tables">Tabs and tables</h3>
<p>The templates, travelers, and binders pages use tabs to separate entities in
different statuses. In each tab, the entities are listed in a table. There are
two places that a button can be placed on a tabbed page. On each list page, when
a button is located on top of the tabs, the button's action is applicable to all
the tabs and tables inside the tabs. When a button is located <strong>inside</strong> a tab,
then the button's action is only applicable to that tab and table.</p>
<p>Around a table, there are 6 areas each of which either hold optional tools or
display information.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>area</th>
<th>location</th>
<th>content</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>top left</td>
<td>a select input to change the number of records shown per table page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>top middle</td>
<td>show a message when the data inside the table is in processing</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>top right</td>
<td>a text input to filter all the columns in the table</td>

<p><br>
<img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/data-tables.png" alt="the areas of a data table"></p>
<p>Some tables have extra tools that allow a user to copy, export, or print the
table. The traveler application uses
<a href="https://datatables.net/">the datatables js library</a> for the tables in web UI.
Many pages in the application are still on an old version of the library, and
the tools are not supported by browsers due to the dependency on the flash
technology. We are in the process of updating those pages to use the latest
version of the datatables library.</p>
<p><br>
<img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/data-table-tools.png" alt="data table tools" style="width:25%"></p>
</section><section id="print"><h3 id="print">Print</h3>
<p>In most cases, the user can print the page to either PDF or a real printer with
the browser's print function. The traveler pages have a dedicated view to be
print format friendly. On a traveler page, clicking on the</p>
<p><button class="btn btn-primary">Create PDF</button> button will open a new tab
of the print view. On the print view, the user can use the top toggles to show
or hide the validation, notes, and details information.</p>
<p>The traveler report page loads the table view of the data inside a group of
travelers. The user can generate a PDF file or print the table with the tools on
the page directly.</p>
</section><section id="color"><h3 id="colors-and-graphical-design">Colors and graphical design</h3>
<p>The traveler application uses a color convention in the interface design. The
buttons are colored according to the possible impact of the actions.</p>
<div><button class="btn btn-primary">primary</button></div>
<div><button class="btn btn-info">information</button></div>
<div><button class="btn btn-success">success</button></div>
<div><button class="btn btn-warning">warning</button></div>
<div><button class="btn btn-danger">danger</button></div>

<p>Each traveler or binder has an estimated progress. The progress is visualized by
a bar. The bar color and corresponding entity status is listed in the following
table.</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->

<p><strong>Audience: traveler users, especially process template owner</strong></p>
<p>Before creating travelers, a user needs to design a template and release it in
the traveler application. A traveler template mimics the paper traveler so that
a process owner defines the sequence of actions and specifies the data to be
collected in each step.</p>
</header><section id="normal"> <h3 id="normal-templates">Normal templates</h3>
<p>Most traveler use cases can be covered with normal templates. The user can
define most common HTML input types, including numbers, date, short text, long
text, radio button, checkbox, and file upload in a normal template. The user can
also include instructive directions of text, diagrams, and formulas in a normal
template. A normal template supports numbered sections for easy navigation and
reference.</p>
</section><section id="discrepancy"><h3 id="discrepancy-template">Discrepancy template</h3>
<p>A discrepancy template can be used for a quality assurance (QA) like process. It
is owned by the QA process owner, who has the responsibility to verify the
result of a traveler. When a traveler is ready for quality assurance, a QA
personal will check if the result meets the expectation. A discrepancy is logged
if the work does not pass QA, which will be followed by a correction. The
correction will be recorded in the traveler with data updates. Then a new QA
iteration can be triggered.</p>
<p>A released discrepancy template cannot used solely without being attached to a
released normal template when creating a traveler.</p>
</section><section id="template-life"><h3 id="states-and-life-cycle-of-a-template">States and life cycle of a template</h3>
<p>The following diagram shows the state transition of a template and a released
template.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/template-life.png" alt="template life cycle">
<figcaption>
States and life cycle of templates
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are two groups of templates: draft and released. Only a released template
can be used to create a traveler. The traveler application supports the review
and approval process of templates.</p>
<p>A template is a draft and editable when created. When a draft template is not
needed any more, the owner can archive it. The owner can clone an archived
template to generate a new draft template if some work needs to be picked up
later.</p>
<p>When a draft template is ready for review, its owner can request one or more
reviewers to check if the template is good to release. A reviewer can either
approve or request for change. When any reviewer requests a change, the review
process ends and the form becomes editable. All the reviewers must approve
before a template can be released.</p>
<p>When a user releases a template after a successful review process, a new
released template is created. The user can choose to archive previously released
templates from the same draft template of different versions. If the draft
template is a normal template, the user can choose to attach a released
discrepancy template with it.</p>
<p>A released template can be archived. Travelers can be created from an archived
released template. This happens when the process is obsoleted or a new process
is available.</p>
</section><section id="builder"><h3 id="template-builder">Template builder</h3>
<p>The template builder is a what-you-see-is-what-you-get editor. It is the
starting point to use the traveler application for most users.</p>
<h4 id="template-type">Template type</h4>
<p>Log in the traveler application, and navigate to the <a href="http://localhost:3001/forms/">Forms or
Templates</a> page. Then click the <a id="new" href="http://localhost:3001/forms/new" target="_blank" data-toggle="tooltip" title="create new empty forms" class="btn btn-primary"><i class="fa fa-file-o fa-lg"></i>&nbsp;New form</a> button.</p>
<p>A new page will load the following page.</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/template-type.png" alt="new template page" style="width:50%">
<figcaption>
New template
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The user needs to set the new template's name, and choose the type. The default
type is <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#normal">normal</a>. The <a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#discrepancy">discrepancy</a> type is for QA
process in order to check the discrepancy of a work. Click <button class="btn btn-primary">Confirm</button> to go to next step. Always start with
the normal type for your first try.</p>
<h4 id="template-components">Template components</h4>
<p>A new template has no inputs inside. The user can add new components, update the
attributes of an existing component, duplicate a component, and adjust the
location of a component.</p>
<h5 id="basic-input-components">Basic input components</h5>
<p>The template builder support 8 basic inputs types:</p>

<h4 id="advanced-components">Advanced components</h4>
<p>Currently, the builder supports two advanced controls, section and rich
instruction. The section is for easy navigation and reference of a traveler.
When a template has sections, a floating navigation will be generated on the
right side of the traveler page. With the navigation, the user can jump to a
section with a click. This is helpful when a template is several pages long.</p>
<p>With rich instruction, a user can add math formulas, web links, images, and
lists to the template. This is useful when the user needs a rich format editor
to compose the paragraph. Note that the image added into the rich instruction
needs to be hosted on a location that a traveler viewer can access. It is
different from the figure in basic input, which accepts an uploaded image file
from the user and saved on the traveler server storage.</p>
<h4 id="update-delete-or-duplicate-a-component">Update, delete, or duplicate a component</h4>
<p>When hovering on an existing template component, the component will be focused
and a set of buttons shows on the top right corner of the component as follows.</p>
<div class="btn-group"><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="edit" class="btn btn-info"><i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg"></i></a><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="duplicate" class="btn btn-info"><i class="fa fa-copy fa-lg"></i></a><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="remove" class="btn btn-warning"><i class="fa
fa-trash-o fa-lg"></i></a></div>

<p>The first button is to show or hide the attribute panel for the component. The
second is to create a new component same to the current component. The third is
to remove the current component from the template.</p>
<h4 id="save-changes">Save changes</h4>
<p>Whenever you update the template by adding a new input, or updating an input's
attributes, or adjusting the locations of the inputs, you can save the change to
the server by clicking the <button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button> button.</p>
<p>When the user tries to save a template, the builder checks if a component's
editor is still open. If it is, then the user will see an alert to finish the
edit first. The user can either commit the change by clicking the</p>
<p><button class="btn btn-primary">Done</button> button, or cancel the change by
clicking the <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="edit" class="btn btn-info"><i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg"></i></a> button again.</p>
<h4 id="sequence-number">Sequence number</h4>
<p>Sequence numbers are added automatically to the components. There are three
levels of numbers: the section is the top level, the second is the rich
instruction, and the third is the basic input.</p>
<pre><code>1 Section name
1.1 instruction for what to do
1.1.1 some data to collect
</code></pre><p>When a new component is added, or a component's location is adjusted, the
numbers are updated automatically. For the templates created with an older
version of the builder, there might not be numbers. The user can generate the
numbers by clicking the <button class="btn btn-primary">Generate
numbering</button> button.</p>
<h4 id="adjust-component-location">Adjust component location</h4>
<p>Click the <button class="btn">Adjust location</button> to enter the location
adjustment mode. The user can drag and drop a component to a different place.
The sequence number will be updated every time a component's location is
changed. Click the <button class="btn">Done</button> to exit the location
adjustment mode. Note that the changes will not be saved until clicking the</p>
<p><button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button> button.</p>
<h4 id="import-other-templates">Import other templates</h4>
<p>In order to make the composition of a new template fast, the user can import the
components inside any draft template or released template into the current
builder. After importing, the user can adjust the location or remove components.</p>
<h4 id="preview-and-validation">Preview and validation</h4>
<p>The user can preview the saved template any time when clicking the <button class="btn btn-info">Preview</button> button. The preview page renders the
template and the validation logic specified in the builder. The user can see the
validation result when clicking the <button class="btn btn-info">Show
validation</button> button.</p>
<h4 id="save-as-a-new-template">Save as a new template</h4>
<p>The user can save the template in the builder as a new template. The new
template can be found in the my draft templates list.</p>
</section><section id="version"><h3 id="template-version-control">Template version control</h3>
<p>When a watched property of a template is updated on the server (the user clicks
the save button), the template version will be incremented. The watched
properties include the title, description, and HTML. The template viewer or
builder always renders the latest version when refreshed.</p>
<p>The user can view the versions with HTML changes by clicking the
<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Check and switch versions" class="btn btn-primary">Version
control</a> button. The user can choose any two versions to compare them side by
side. Note that not all the details of template HTML are viewable when rendered,
e.g. the input validation rules like min and max value of a number. The user can
"revert" the template to an old version by clicking the</p>
<p><button data-toggle="tooltip" title="Create a new version" class="btn btn-primary use">Use</button>
button. In order to record the change, a new version is created for the
template.</p>
<p><img src="./Lab Traveler - user manual_files/version-control.png" alt="version control"></p>
</section><section id="review"><h3 id="template-review-and-release-process">Template review and release process</h3>
<p>A traveler can only be created from a released template. A released template is
created when a draft template is approved by the reviewers and released after
that. When the owner finishes editing a template, s/he can request a template
review by click on the <button class="btn btn-primary">Submit for
review</button> button.</p>
<p>All the submitted templates are listed on the under review templates tab. On the
template review page, the template owner can add or remove reviewers. A reviewer
is a user with the reviewer role. When any reviewer requests change in the form,
the review process is stopped. All past review results and comments for specific
versions are viewable for future reference. The review process restarts when the
owner makes changes and submits for review again.</p>
<p>When all the reviewers approve the template of the current version, the <button class="btn btn-primary">Release</button> button will appear on the template
page. When the owner releases the approved template, a new released template is
created. The approved template is listed on the approved and released template
table.</p>
<h4 id="reviewer">Reviewer</h4>
<p><strong>Audience: admin and reviewer</strong></p>
<p>A normal traveler user cannot review templates. The admin needs to add the
reviewer role to the users who want to perform the task. A reviewer sees <a href="http://localhost:3001/reviews/">Reviews</a> link on top of the traveler page. The reviews page
lists all the active templates under review. The reviewer can approve or request
for more works for a template. A template needs to be approved by all the
reviewers before release. A single rework request from any reviewer will
terminate the review process, and the template becomes editable again. A
reviewer can request change for a template that s/he has approved before it is
released by the template's owner.</p>

</section><section id="traveler-view"><h3 id="view-a-traveler">View a traveler</h3>
<p><strong>Audience: traveler users</strong></p>
<p>The user can directly load the traveler in the browser with a traveler's URL. If
the user has only read permission of the traveler, the browser will redirect to
a read-only view. On the travelers page, click on the
<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="go to the traveler"><i class="fa fa-edit fa-lg"></i></a>
icon in order to the traveler page.</p>
<p>In a traveler page, the top line is the traveler's title. Below the title is the
traveler status, and progress. The progress tells the number of inputs updated
out of the total inputs. The numbers represent only rough progress
<strong>estimation</strong> of the traveler. A traveler can be complete when some inputs have
not be updated.</p>
<p>The <button class="btn btn-info collapsed">Details</button> button shows/hides
some detailed information of the traveler including the description, creation
user/time and last update user/time. The details information is hidden by
default.</p>

<span class="badge badge-info">n</span> icon shows the number of notes.</p>
<p>The value displayed in an input is the latest value saved on the server. The
history of changes is shown under each input including the submitted value,
submitter id and submission time.</p>
<p>When a traveler has several sections, a side navigation menu is created on the
right side. When scrolling up and down the page, the section corresponding to
the content in the current view is highlighted in the navigation menu.</p>
</section><section id="traveler-update"><h3 id="update-the-data-and-notes-in-a-traveler">Update the data and notes in a traveler</h3>
<p><strong>Audience: traveler users with write permission</strong></p>
<p>In order to update the data and notes of a traveler, the user must have the
write permission of the traveler.</p>
<p>A traveler's data can be updated only when it is in the
<a href="http://localhost:3001/docs/#traveler-status">active status</a>. When the traveler is in other statuses, all
the inputs are disabled on the traveler page. Note on the traveler view page,
the user cannot update data or notes on that page even if s/he has write
permission.</p>
<p>When the user inputs a new value in an input, two buttons will appear on the
right side. Click the <button value="save" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
button to submit the change to the traveler server. Or click the</p>
<p><button value="reset" class="btn">Reset</button> button to reset to the original
value. All other inputs are disable when an input is touched. If the change is
saved on the server, there will be a</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-success"><button class="close">x</button>Success</div>
message on the top of the page. If something is wrong, then an <p></p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-error"><button class="close">x</button>Error</div>

<h3 id="manage-templates-in-a-traveler-deprecated-">Manage templates in a traveler (deprecated)</h3>
<p>This feature was <strong>removed</strong> after we implemented a template release process.
The rational is that we should not change the traveler specification (templates)
once it is executed in the field. If there is any change to the template, there
should be a new traveler based on a new released template.</p>

</section></article></section><section id="faq"><article><section id="faq"><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Audience: all users</strong></p>
<p><em>Q: I cannot save the updates and I have the write permission.</em></p>
<p>A: If you see warning messages on the top of the traveler page when you made
updates, then the warning message should include the reason. If your session is
timed out, you can log in in a new browser tab or windows, and come back the
current tab and continue.</p>
<p><em>Q: My browser cannot find the traveler server.</em></p>
<p>A: Please connect to VPN and load the traveler application URL.</p>
<p><em>Q: How to delete a template, a traveler or a binder?</em></p>
<p>A: You <strong>cannot</strong> delete an entity (a form, a traveler, or a binder) in the
traveler application once it is created. You can <strong>archive</strong> them. You can
always <strong>de-archive</strong> an entity from your "archived" tab, to work on them again.</p>
<p><em>Q: How to correct the data or note in a traveler?</em></p>
<p>A: You <strong>cannot</strong> "revise" the input data in a traveler. You can always input a
new value into the input where you want to correct. You might also want to add a
note to the input in order to explain the reason for the update.</p>
<p><em>Q: I cannot update the data in a traveler.</em></p>
<p>A: If you cannot load the traveler page, then you do not have permission to view
