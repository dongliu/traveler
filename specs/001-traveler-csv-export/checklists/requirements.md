# Specification Quality Checklist: Traveler CSV Export

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Initial draft required no clarifications: the feature description specified the required export
  fields explicitly, and remaining decisions (access control model, file-value representation, row
  granularity) had clear, low-risk defaults documented in the spec's Assumptions section.
- One clarification was resolved in the 2026-08-23 session: whether to add the field's internal
  name as a stable reference column (see Clarifications section in spec.md).
- All checklist items pass.
